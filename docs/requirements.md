## Requirements Tracking

We used ZenHub on [this](https://github.com/radichub/aws-opinion.net#workspaces/475-capstone-634308826f0ac5116c5e7dee/board) repository to keep track of our issues and make sure we were meeting all requirements. Weekly meetings occured where the team lead assigned various issues in ZenHub to developers on the team. As developers successfully implemented code to account for each requirement, he/she closed their issue in ZenHub. The Zenhub accurately reflections the distribution of work and progress across the team.
